# Inside Parity Protocol

_A real-time, trustless, slightly angry compute network built with Docker, hash comparisons, and no tolerance for bullshit._

## Why This Exists

Everyone loves saying “decentralized compute.” Most of them mean “expensive cloud wrappers” or “semi-centralized trust games with extra steps.”

We wanted something simpler:

- You submit a job
- Multiple machines run it in the same environment
- If the outputs match, you can trust it
- If they don’t, someone’s cheating (or bad at writing deterministic code)

That’s it. Parity Protocol runs today. It’s lean, deterministic, and slightly hostile to corner-cutters.

## The Architecture (Nothing Hypothetical)

Here's how things actually work:

1. A task is submitted: includes a Docker image or Dockerfile, input payload, and expected behavior.
2. Runner nodes pick it up from the network.
3. Each runner spins up a **fresh Docker container**, executes the task, and produces an output.
4. Outputs are hashed and published.
5. If enough hashes match, we assume it’s legit. Matching runners get paid. Others get ignored.

It’s dumb-simple by design. Complexity invites exploits. We don’t have room for those.

## Determinism or You Don’t Get Paid

You can’t use randomness, system clocks, or hidden state. We catch that instantly via hash mismatches.

If you run a task twice and the outputs don’t match, congratulations—you’ve disqualified yourself. This includes:

- Using `Math.random()` without a seed
- Accessing current time
- Reading from disk without strict input bounds
- Any "AI magic" that changes output on each run

No amount of excuses or clever logging will change it. The system does not negotiate.

## The Role of Docker (and Why We Trust It More Than You)

Every runner executes tasks in a **Docker container** spun up from scratch per job. That means:

- No leftover memory
- No cached files
- No surprise network calls
- Same environment across all runners

You define your environment; we isolate it and enforce it. If your job depends on GPU availability or accessing `/dev/random`, it’s not going to work here.

This isn’t about being flexible. It’s about being correct.

## The Reward System: Brutally Fair

- A task is run by multiple nodes.
- Their outputs are hashed and compared.
- Matching nodes split the reward.
- Non-matching nodes get nothing.
- If you mismatch consistently, we stop assigning you work.

No staking. No reputation. No social capital. You either matched or didn’t.

There is no retry loop for incompetence. Either your environment is reproducible or you’re wasting everyone’s electricity.

## What It Can Run (Right Now)

This is not a theoretical system. It runs real tasks. Today. Examples include:

- AI model inference (if deterministic and CPU-bound)
- Static analysis tools
- File transformation pipelines
- ZK proof generation
- Data scoring, parsing, linting, compiling

Basically: anything that

- Runs inside a Docker container
- Doesn't rely on external state or timing
- Can be verified by matching outputs across multiple machines

No GPU support. No async callbacks. No cloud APIs. Just input → code → output → hash.

## Tooling Already Live

- **Task Submission CLI**: Push tasks directly into the network from your terminal.
- **Runner Daemon**: Any machine can become a compute node, execute tasks, and earn.
- **Containerized Execution**: All tasks run in isolated containers.
- **Consensus via Hash Matching**: Verifiability is based on real output equality, not trust.
- **Reward Payouts**: Real token payments to matching nodes.

Everything here is built. Running. Used. No pitch decks or vaporware.

## Design Philosophy

- No trust, no reputation, no staking-as-a-filter
- No complex coordination protocols
- Every job is independently verifiable by re-execution
- Incentives are tight, minimal, and enforced by logic, not vibe
- Assume malicious actors exist; remove their influence through architecture, not policing

## Summary

Parity Protocol does one thing: runs jobs across multiple machines in Docker, compares outputs, and rewards agreement.
It doesn’t ask you to believe in it.
It shows you the hash and dares you to dispute it.
If you're still clinging to centralized cloud infra that bills you $80 to convert a CSV, we get it. We've been there.
This is what we built to replace that.
And it's already running.
