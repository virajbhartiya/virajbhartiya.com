_My portfolio. Because apparently everyone needs one. Here's mine._

---

## What This Is

It's a website. About me. Built because recruiters kept asking for one and I got tired of explaining what I do.

**Not another generic developer portfolio.** This one actually works, looks decent, and doesn't make your eyes bleed.

### What I Actually Care About

- **It works**: No broken links, no 404s, no "coming soon" bullshit
- **It's fast**: Because nobody has time for slow websites
- **It's responsive**: Works on your phone, tablet, and that weird ultrawide monitor you bought
- **It's honest**: No fake metrics, no inflated numbers, just real projects

---

## Tech Stack (The Stuff That Actually Matters)

| Thing | What I Used | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Frontend** | React 18, TypeScript | Because vanilla JS is for masochists |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Because writing CSS is boring |
| **Animation** | Lenis, AOS, Spline | Because static is boring |
| **Build** | Vite | Because Webpack is slow as hell |
| **Hosting** | Vercel | Because it just works |

---

## Features (The Cool Shit)

### What You'll Actually Notice
- Smooth scrolling that doesn't make you nauseous
- 3D stuff that actually looks good
- Animations that serve a purpose (not just because I can)
- Mobile experience that doesn't suck

### What You Won't Notice (But Should)
- TypeScript everywhere (because runtime errors are for amateurs)
- Proper accessibility (because not everyone can see)
- Performance optimization (because slow sites are trash)
- Clean code (because future me will thank present me)

---

## Getting Started (If You Really Want To)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- npm (or yarn, I don't care)
- Basic understanding of how computers work

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this thing
git clone https://github.com/virajbhartiya/virajbhartiya.com.git

# Go into the folder
cd virajbhartiya.com

# Install stuff
npm install

# Run it
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and there you go.

### Commands That Actually Work

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run dev` | Starts the dev server (obviously) |
| `npm run build` | Builds for production |
| `npm run preview` | Shows you the built version |
| `npm run lint` | Yells at you for bad code |

---

## Deployment

It's on **Vercel** because:
- It's free
- It works
- I don't have to think about it

**Live at**: [virajbhartiya.com](https://virajbhartiya.com)
